```

So our simple project is `292K` and it takes `345ms` to compile, and `8.25ms`
to execute.

## With Serialization

Serializing the module takes `5m` and loading serialised module from disc take
`0.5ms` (`585.083Âµs`). The serialised file size is `661K`.

## GZip

GZip brings the wasm file size down from `292K` to `115K`, the serialized module
snapshot from `661K` to `247K`.
